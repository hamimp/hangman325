## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

In this programme the game chooses the name of a fruit randomly from a list of fruits and asks the player to guess a letter. If the letter is present in the name of the fruit then the player will be informed of their guess to be correct. Otherwise, it will tell the player that the guessed letter is incorrect and to try again. There are a set number of lives which will be deducted each time an incorrect  guess is made by the player. If the player is able to guess all the letters while the have enough lives left, then they will win the game
